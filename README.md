# 3D Model Viewer with React Three Fiber

This project demonstrates a 3D model viewer built using **React Three Fiber**, **@react-three/drei**, and **Leva** for interactive controls. The viewer displays a rotating 3D model of a ring along with a dynamic text label. The material properties of the model can be controlled using a user interface provided by Leva.

## Features

- **Rotating 3D Model**: A 3D ring model (loaded from a GLTF file) that rotates along the X-axis.
- **Interactive Controls**: Adjust material properties such as thickness, roughness, transmission, and chromatic aberration using Leva controls.
- **Environment**: A city-themed environment is applied to the scene.
- **Responsive**: The scene scales to fit the viewport size, ensuring a flexible user experience.
